Hi everyone.  I'm a Linux and Open Source guy from way back.  I've been
involved in a lot of different projects over the years, including <a
href="http://samba.org/">Samba</tt>, <a
href="http://debian.org/">Debian</a>, <a
href="http://openpegasus.org/">OpenPegasus</a> and a bunch more.

I've been employed at Hewlett-Packard, now Hewlett Packard enterprise 
since 2001 working on supporting Linux on HP/HPE hardware as well as writing 
and contributing to Open Source software.

My hobbies are poetry and lifting heavy things.
