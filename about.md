Hi everyone.  I'm a Linux and Open Source guy from way back.  I've been
involved in a lot of different projects over the years, including <a
href="http://samba.org/">Samba</tt>, <a
href="http://debian.org/">Debian</a>, <a
href="http://openpegasus.org/">OpenPegasus</a> and a bunch more.

I've been employed at HP since 2001 working on supporting Linux on HP
hardware and writing and contributing to Open Source software.

My hobbies are poetry and lifting heavy things.
